# Color detector

A very basic color detector for detecting either red, green or blue in a certain screen space.

All of the important parameters are located at the beginning of the script file (main.py). **MODIFY THEM BEFORE USE**.

The code was ai generated and tweaked in order to fix bugs. It isn't well written and only serves as a PoC.

## Requirements

opencv requires `openh264-1.8.0-win64.dll` file in order to function when using the h264 codec.

Download it from here: <https://github.com/cisco/openh264/releases/tag/v1.8.0>

You can choose where to store it according to the **Dynamic-link library search order**: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order>.

## Example

Example input and it's outputs is available at the **example** directory.
